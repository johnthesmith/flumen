Flumen Theory — A Concept for Modeling Spaces and relationships between them using abstract objects 
called Flumens. The theory aims to describe multidimensional structures with the minimal number 
of fundamental elements, excluding traditional concepts of coordinates and measurements.

# What is a Flumen?
 
[Flumen](./en/flumen) (Latin: flumen stream) — an abstract mathematical direction between two natural numbers 
with unit length. It is analogous to a directed edge in a graph. An important note: a flumen 
does not have coordinates or space in the traditional sense. It is a simple abstraction that 
can serve as a building block for creating more complex structures.

# Spaces and Flumens

Combinations of flumens can be used to create spatial structures. For example, several flumens 
can form closed or open multidimensional structures. For instance, connecting multiple flumens, 
each with one direction, allows the creation of a space with multiple dimensions. The space can 
be multidimensional within the flumens, but the observer, following these flumens, may perceive 
it as having fewer dimensions.

# How Do flumens Work?

Flumens cannot move by themselves. Instead, movement occurs at the level of the observer, 
who moves through the flumens and perceives the structure of the space. flumens can be seen 
as channels or paths through which signals and events pass.

# The Variety of Spaces

Flumens allow the creation of a vast variety of multidimensional spaces with different topologies. 
Closed spaces, infinite spaces, and parallel spaces are all possible. flumens enable the creation 
of seamless spaces with mixed dimensions, wormholes, and other possible artifacts.

# The Observer

In Flumen Theory, the observer is a being that moves through the flumens, perceiving and exploring 
the structure of the flumen space. The observer does not interact with the flumens directly but moves 
along their directions, allowing them to interpret the space as limited or multidimensional 
depending on the context.

The observer may perceive the space as a complete model, even though inside it exists a more 
complex multidimensional structure. This is true in reverse as well. Measurements may seem limited 
(e.g., a 3D space), but in reality, they may be closed and have a hidden dimension (e.g., a fourth dimension).

# Applications and Prospects

Flumen Theory can be useful for creating abstract models of space that do not rely on traditional 
physical concepts. This approach can be applied in theoretical physics, mathematics, and for modeling 
more complex networks and systems in various fields.
