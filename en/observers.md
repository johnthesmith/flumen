1. [Flumen Theory](../README.md) recommends reading the description of observers for understanding:
    1. [Internal Observer](#internal-observer)
    0. [External Observer](#external-observer)

# Internal Observer

An internal observer is a subject whose perception and understanding of space are entirely determined by the internal properties of that space. All characteristics, such as coordinates, distances, sizes, and directions, are accessible only through interactions with the elements of the model. For the internal observer, space exists solely as a set of relationships defined by [flumens](./flumen.md). They cannot go beyond these relationships or comprehend the existence of an external perspective.

# External Observer

An external observer is a subject who is not constrained by the formal parameters of space, such as coordinates, distances, or directions. They perceive the system as a whole, including its structure, connections, and topology, but outside the context of any internal rules or limitations. The external observer can view the model as an abstraction, evaluate its properties externally, and understand how it is constructed and functions without being tied to any predefined local dimensions.

# Example

For an internal observer, the flumen \( F(0,1) \) merely defines the direction from point 0 to point 1.  
An external observer sees that \( F(0,1) \) is part of a more complex structure, potentially linked to other dimensions or even other spaces.

# Difference

An external observer views the model as a concept, free from coordinates, geometry, and local constraints, whereas the internal observer is bound by the laws dictated by the internal configuration of the space.
